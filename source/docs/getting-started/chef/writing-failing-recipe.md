So far our cookbook has no dependencies on other cookbooks to get its job done which is awesome! But let's say we require dependant cookbooks. For our example we'll be relying on the [runit](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/runit) cookbook to manage our Git Daemon service.


With this solution in mind we'll create a file called `recipes/server.rb` with the following:

~~~ruby
include_recipe "git"
include_recipe "runit"

package "git-daemon-run"

runit_service "git-daemon" do
  sv_templates false
end
~~~

Reasonably straight forward code. Here's what is going on:

* We include our default Git recipe so that Git is installed. Hey we already solved that one, right?
* We include the default recipe from the runit cookbook which installs runit and provides the `runit_service` resource.
* We install the `git-daemon-run` package which gives us the `git-daemon` program, on Ubuntu 12.04 at least.
* Finally, we declare a runit service called `git-daemon` without generating the run and log scripts (they were provided by the Ubuntu package).

Now to see the fruits of our effort:

See what the Chef run told you?

>> "Cookbook runit not found. If you're loading runit from another cookbook, make sure you configure the dependency in your metadata"

Hey, that's exactly what we need to do!
