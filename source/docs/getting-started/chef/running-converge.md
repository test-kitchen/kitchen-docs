Now that we have some code, let's let Test Kitchen run it for us on our Ubuntu 12.04 instance:

~~~

To quote our Chef run, that **was** too easy. If you are a Chef user then part of the output above should look familiar to you. Here's what happened at a high level:

* Chef was installed on the instance by performing an [Omnibus package installation](http://www.opscode.com/chef/install/)
* Your Git cookbook files and a minimal Chef Solo configuration were built and uploaded to the instance
* A Chef run was initiated using the run-list and node attributes specified in the `.kitchen.yml` file

There's nothing to stop you from running this command again (or over-and-over for that matter) so, let's see what happens:

That ran a **lot** faster didn't it? Here's what happened this time:

* Test Kitchen found that Chef was present and installed so skipped a re-installation.
* The same Chef cookbook files and Chef Solo configuration was uploaded to the instance. Test Kitchen is optimizing for **freshness of code and configuration over speed**. Although we all like speed wherever possible.
* A Chef run is initiated and runs very quickly as we are in the desired state.

|| Pro-Tip
|| A lot of time and effort has gone into ensuring that the exit code of Test Kitchen is always appropriate. Here is the Kitchen Command Guarantee:
|| 1. I will always exit with code **0** if my operation was successful.
|| 2. I will always exit with a non-zero code if **any** part of my operation was not successful.
|| 3. Any behavior to the contrary **is a bug**.
|| This exit code behavior is a fundamental prerequisite for any tool working in a Continuous Integration (CI) environment.

Let's check the status of our instance:

~~~
$ kitchen list
Instance             Driver   Provisioner  Last Action
default-ubuntu-1204  Vagrant  ChefSolo     Converged
~~~

A clean converge run, success! Let's commit our production code and move on:

~~~
$ git add recipes/default.rb
$ git commit -m "Implemented the default recipe, woot woot."
[master 4d54a16] Implemented the default recipe, woot woot.
