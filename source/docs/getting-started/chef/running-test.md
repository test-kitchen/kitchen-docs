Now it's time to introduce to the **test** meta-action which helps you automate all the previous actions so far into one command. Recall that we currently have our instance in a "verified" state. With this in mind, let's run `kitchen test`:

~~~

There's only one remaining action left that needs a mention: the **Destroy Action** which... destroys the instance. With this in mind, here's what Test Kitchen is doing in the **Test Action**:

1. Destroys the instance if it exists (`Cleaning up any prior instances of <default-ubuntu-1204>`)
2. Creates the instance (`Creating <default-ubuntu-1204>`)
3. Converges the instance (`Converging <default-ubuntu-1204>`)
4. Sets up Busser and runner plugins on the instance (`Setting up <default-ubuntu-1204>`)
5. Verifies the instance by running Busser tests (`Verifying <default-ubuntu-1204>`)
6. Destroys the instance (`Destroying <default-ubuntu-1204>`)

A few details with regards to test:

* Test Kitchen will abort the run on the instance at the first sign of trouble. This means that if your Chef run fails then Busser won't be installed and the instance won't be destroyed. This gives you a chance to inspect the state of the instance and fix any issues.
* The behavior of the final destroy action can be overridden if desired. Check out the documentation for the `--destroy` flag using `kitchen help test`.
* The primary use case in mind for this meta-action is in a Continuous Integration environment or a command for developers to run before check in or after a fresh clone. If you're using this in your test-code-verify development cycle it's going to quickly become very slow and frustrating. You're better off running the **converge** and **verify** subcommands in development and save the **test** subcommand when you need to verify the end-to-end run of your code.

Finally, let's check the status of the instance:

~~~
$ kitchen list
Instance             Driver   Provisioner  Last Action
default-ubuntu-1204  Vagrant  ChefSolo     <Not Created>
~~~

Back to square one.
