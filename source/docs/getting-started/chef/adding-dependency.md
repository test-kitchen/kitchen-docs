To add a dependency to our cookbook we edit the `metadata.rb` file and the runit cookbook with a `depends` statement:

~~~ruby
name "git"
version "0.1.0"

depends "runit", "~> 1.4.0"
~~~

Note that we're adding a constraint on the version of the runit cookbook. While this isn't strictly required it is something you want to consider as cookbooks can introduce breaking changes in the future.

Now, let's see if we get to pass our tests:

~~~

Hmm, Chef still seems to be confused. We've told Chef that we depend on the runit cookbook yet it's still complaining about our metadata.

What we need is a Chef cookbook dependency resolver tool to fetch our missing cookbooks so that Test Kitchen can use them in the Chef run. Here's the high level logic that Test Kitchen traverses in order to help you with your cookbook dependencies (again, first match wins):

1. Do you have a `Berksfile` in your project directory? If so, Test Kitchen will use [Berkshelf](http://berkshelf.com/) to resolve dependencies.
2. Do you have a `Cheffile` in your project directory? If so, Test Kitchen will use [Librarian-Chef](https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian-chef) to resolve dependencies.
3. Do you have a `cookbooks/` directory in your project directory? If so, Test Kitchen will use that.
4. Do you have a `metadata.rb` file in your project directory? If so, then this project is a cookbook and Test Kitchen will use that.
5. Otherwise we're out of options, so Test Kitchen will create a fake cookbook and use that so that Chef has just enough to perform an empty Chef run.

For this guide, we'll use Berkshelf to fetch runit for us.

To get started we need to install the berkshelf gem--Test Kitchen doesn't depend on this library directly since it's one of many options:

Next we'll create the smallest `Berksfile`, using your editor of choice:

~~~ruby
source "https://api.berkshelf.com"

metadata
~~~

The `metadata` command tells Berkshelf that the current project is a Chef cookbook and to use its `metadata.rb` as a source of cookbook dependencies.

Now, let's re-run `kitchen verify`:

Awesome, and tests pass! Did you notice the `Resolving cookbook dependencies with Berkshelf...` line near the beginning? Confirming our success:

~~~
$ kitchen list server

Now let's backfill the other platforms.
