Now to write a test or two. Previously we've seen the bats testing framework in action but this isn't always a viable option. For example if you needed to verify that a package was installed and you needed to test that on Ubuntu and CentOS platforms, then what would you do? You need to bust out some platform detection in order to run a Debian or RPM-based command. Feels like Chef would help us here since it's good at that sort of thing. On the other hand there are advantages to treating our Chef run as a black box - a configuration-management implementation detail, if you will. So what to do?

A nice solution to the platform-agnostic test issue exists called [Serverspec](http://serverspec.org/). It is a set of RSpec matchers that can assert things about servers like packages installed, services enabled, ports listening, etc. Let's see what this looks like for our Git Daemon tests.

First we're going to create a directory for our test file:

~~~
mkdir -p test/integration/server/serverspec
~~~

Next, create a file called `test/integration/server/serverspec/git_daemon_spec.rb` with the following:

~~~ruby
require 'serverspec'

# Required by serverspec
set :backend, :exec

describe "Git Daemon" do

  it "is listening on port 9418" do
    expect(port(9418)).to be_listening
  end

  it "has a running service of git-daemon" do
    expect(service("git-daemon")).to be_running
  end

end
~~~

The beginning stanzas are RSpec and Serverspec setup and the meat of our testing is in the `describe "Git Daemon"` Ruby block. In short, it's asserting that we will have a server listening on port 9418 and a running service called "git-daemon".

As our primary target platform was Ubuntu 12.04, we'll target this one first for development. Now, in Test-Driven style we'll run `kitchen verify` to watch our tests fail spectacularly:

~~~

One quick check of `kitchen list` tells us that our instance was created but not successfully converged:

~~~
$ kitchen list server-ubuntu-1204
Instance            Driver   Provisioner  Last Action
server-ubuntu-1204  Vagrant  ChefSolo     Created
~~~

Yes, you can specify one or more instances with the same Ruby regular expression globbing as any other `kitchen` subcommands.

Okay, no recipe called `server` in our Git cookbook. Let's go start one.
