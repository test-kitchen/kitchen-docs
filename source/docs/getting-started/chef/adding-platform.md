Now that we are masters of the Ubuntu platform, let's add support for CentOS to our cookbook. This shouldn't be too bad. Open `.kitchen.yml` in your editor and the `centos-6.4` line to your platforms list so that it resembles:

~~~yaml
---
driver:
  name: vagrant

provisioner:
  name: chef_solo

platforms:
  - name: ubuntu-12.04
  - name: centos-6.4

suites:
  - name: default
    run_list:
      - recipe[git::default]
    attributes:
~~~

Now let's check the status of our instances:

~~~
$ kitchen list
Instance             Driver   Provisioner  Last Action
default-ubuntu-1204  Vagrant  Chef Solo    <Not Created>
default-centos-64    Vagrant  Chef Solo    <Not Created>
~~~

We're going to use two shortcuts here in the next command:

* Each Test Kitchen instance has a simple state machine that tracks where it is in its lifecyle. Given its current state and the desired state, the instance is smart enough to run all actions in between current and desired. In our next example we will take an instance from not created to verified in one command.
* Any `kitchen` subcommand that takes an instance name as an argument can take a Ruby regular expression that will be used to glob a list of instances together. This means that `kitchen test ubuntu` would run the **test** action only the ubuntu instance. Note that the **list** subcommand also takes the regex-globbing argument so feel free to experiment there. In our next example we'll select the `default-centos-64` instance with simply `64`.

Let's see how CentOS runs our cookbook:

~~~

Nice! We've verified that our cookbook works on Ubuntu 12.04 and CentOS 6.4. Since the CentOS instance will hang out for no good reason, let's kill it for now:

~~~
$ kitchen destroy
-----> Starting Kitchen (v1.0.0.beta.3)

       Finished destroying <default-ubuntu-1204> (0m0.00s).

       [kitchen::driver::vagrant command] END (0m2.79s)
       Vagrant instance <default-centos-64> destroyed.
       Finished destroying <default-centos-64> (0m3.09s).
-----> Kitchen is finished. (0m3.39s)
~~~

Interesting. Test Kitchen tried to destroy both instances, one that was created and the other that was not. Which brings us to another tip with the `kitchen` command:

> **Any `kitchen` subcommand without an instance argument will apply to all instances.**

Let's make sure everything has been destroyed:

~~~
$ kitchen list
Instance             Driver   Provisioner  Last Action
default-ubuntu-1204  Vagrant  Chef Solo    <Not Created>
default-centos-64    Vagrant  Chef Solo    <Not Created>
~~~

There's no production code change so far but we did modify the `.kitchen.yml` file, so let's commit that:

~~~
$ git add .kitchen.yml
> git commit -m "Add support for CentOS 6.4."
[master 528ac72] Add support for CentOS 6.4.
